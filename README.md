 Healthcare Delivery Process – Performance Analysis
 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and improving the performance of a Healthcare Delivery Process within a hospital or clinic.
The study models patient flow, staff utilization, and service efficiency to identify bottlenecks and propose data-driven improvements.

 Objectives

Measure and minimize patient waiting times.

Optimize resource and staff utilization.

Identify bottlenecks in patient flow across departments.

Analyze service efficiency and appointment management.

 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of five CSV files, each representing a key component of the healthcare system:

File Name	Description
patients.csv	Contains patient demographics and visit information.
appointments.csv	Records appointment schedules and outcomes.
staff.csv	Details hospital staff roles, shifts, and departments.
service_log.csv	Logs service events including waiting and service times.
resources.csv	Tracks hospital resources, availability, and utilization.
